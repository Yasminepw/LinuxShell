My program is a simple command line shell that executes commands (either built in or through an enviroment path) 
read from the standard input or from a file. I had to change a lot of what I originally had in my psudocode because 
I found ways to impliment functions in an easier and more efficient way. I tested by program after implimentation of each new command 
and found it to be clearer by creating a separate file to place my builtins in. I have trouble implimenting the following: 
cat < inputfile >> outputfile  

For example the file test.txt is what was used as a batch file test. Examples of tests I did for '>', '>>', '<', and '&' can be found 
int README_DOC.
